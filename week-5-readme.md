# Week 5

## Hooks are ...

`const [firstname, setFirstName] = useState()`

- firstName is overwritten with SetFirstName

## Study:

- event
- htmlFor

## Notes:

- We identify form ID's by name
- Using destructing makes it easier to read the code (not for beginners though)
- If the property of useState is not defined, it will be added.

## Multiple pages in SPA

### Router (know these)

- RouterProvider
- createBrowserRouter
