# Week 4

## Destructuring props (Makes passing arguments to a function in more cleaner manner)

- Destruct the array
- Rest (...rest) operator to be used if other properties are unknown.
  - Use (...rest.objectvalue) to access

## PrevState

- When something is happening too fast, code might not keep up. For instance while checking with backend.

## Passing event to child component.

App > Button

## Task:

In console log we should see which card was clicked.

- App.jsx:
  - const handleClick was defined
  - click={handleClick} was passed to <Card>
- In Card.jsx:
  - Import Button
  - Add Button to card with click.
